# Path-Detection
path coloration has become popular in real time vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). The main emphasis of this is to find the further ways which can be used further to improve the result of path detection algorithms. Noise, visibility etc. can reduce the performance or the existing path detection algorithms.path coloration has become popular in real time vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). The main emphasis of this paper is to find the further ways which can be used further to improve the result of path detection algorithms. Noise, visibility etc. can reduce the performance or the existing path detection algorithms. The methods developed so far are working efficiently and giving good results in case when noise is not present in the images. But problem is that they fail or not give efficient results when there is any kind of noise or fog in the road images. The noise can be anything like dust, shadows, puddles, oil stains, tire skid marks, etc.
